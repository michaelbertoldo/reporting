// Schedule-of-investments positions, derived from the portfolio tracker rather
// than the ledger. The ledger knows only totals (one investment-cost account, one
// unrealized account); the tracker knows the per-company detail an ASC 946 SOI
// needs — shares, price, industry. So the SOI reads the tracker for its ROWS and
// the ledger for its CONTROL TOTALS, and reports the variance between them.
//
// Valuation math is NOT reimplemented here: computeSummary() in lib/investments.ts
// is the canonical roll-up (priced equity → shares × latest price; SAFEs/notes →
// cost + cumulative value change). There are already several drifted copies of it
// in the codebase; this is deliberately not another one.
